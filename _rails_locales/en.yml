    Confidential Links can be used to enable access to Entries without making
    them publicly visible.

    These Links therefore also make it possible to share Entries with Users that
    don't have a login. Please do not share or embed Confidential Links onto
    publicly accessible websites, because it would render the regular permission
    settings useless.

    Confidential Links can only be created by the responsible user of an Entry.
    They can be manually revoked at any time, and optionally be set to expire
    automatically after a set day.
